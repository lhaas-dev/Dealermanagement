# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          comment: "🔧 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Identified and fixed the root cause of the CSV import update issue where vehicles were being 'updated' but not appearing in frontend. ISSUE: The CSV update logic was not setting critical fields (current_month, current_year, archive_status) when updating existing cars, causing them to potentially have wrong values that excluded them from frontend queries. FIX: Modified CSV import update logic to explicitly set current_month=current month, current_year=current year, and archive_status='active' for all updated cars. VALIDATION: Tested the fix with comprehensive scenarios - all updated cars now appear correctly in all frontend queries (no filters, current month/year, status filters, stats endpoint). This resolves the user's issue where '36 Fahrzeuge verarbeitet: 0 neu importiert, 36 aktualisiert' showed cars were updated but 'Gesamt Fahrzeuge: 0' indicated they weren't appearing in frontend."

      message: "🔍 CSV IMPORT DISPLAY ISSUE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive investigation of reported issue where 'CSV import works but imported vehicles don't appear in frontend'. FINDINGS: ✅ Backend CSV import functionality is working perfectly - all imported cars are properly stored with correct default values (status: absent, archive_status: active, current_month/year: correct). ✅ All API endpoints return imported cars correctly with various filters (no filters, month/year filters, status filters, search queries). ✅ Imported cars appear in available months endpoint. ✅ All database fields are set correctly. CONCLUSION: The CSV import and backend data retrieval functionality is working correctly. If users are experiencing display issues, the problem is likely in the frontend JavaScript code, browser caching, or user interface state management, not in the backend API or data storage."

      message: "🚨 URGENT CSV UPDATE ISSUE RESOLVED: Investigated and fixed the critical issue where vehicles were being 'updated' but not appearing in frontend (Toast: '36 Fahrzeuge verarbeitet: 0 neu importiert, 36 aktualisiert' but 'Gesamt Fahrzeuge: 0'). ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: CSV import update logic was not setting critical fields (current_month, current_year, archive_status) when updating existing cars, causing them to have wrong values that excluded them from frontend queries. CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Modified CSV import update logic in /app/backend/server.py to explicitly set current_month=current month, current_year=current year, and archive_status='active' for all updated cars during CSV import. COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION: ✅ Created test scenario with existing cars ✅ Updated via CSV import (0 new, 2 updated) ✅ Verified all updated cars have correct critical fields ✅ Confirmed updated cars appear in all frontend queries (no filters, current month/year, status filters, archive status filters) ✅ Validated stats endpoint includes updated cars ✅ All 24/24 tests passed. RESULT: The CSV import update issue has been completely resolved - updated vehicles now appear correctly in frontend immediately after CSV import, fixing the user's critical issue."
