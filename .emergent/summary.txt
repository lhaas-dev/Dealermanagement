The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive car dealership inventory management system. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with basic CRUD operations and progressively adding complex features like CSV import, photo verification, a robust login system with role-based access control, and customization of core data fields. A significant portion of the trajectory involved meticulous debugging, particularly for CSV import issues (duplicate VINs, BOM characters) and frontend-backend synchronization (delete function, login state). The engineer consistently addressed user feedback, ensuring both functional correctness and an improved user experience, even for subtle issues like invisible CSV characters. The work is now focused on implementing a monthly archiving system, which involves both backend and frontend modifications for managing historical inventory data.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an application for a car dealership to manage and verify car inventory. The core problem is to efficiently track which cars are physically present at the garage.

Initially, the app needed basic CRUD operations for cars, allowing staff to mark cars as present or absent.

Subsequent requirements included:
-   **CSV Bulk Upload**: Import inventory data from a CSV file, with all imported cars defaulting to absent status.
-   **Photo Verification**: To mark a car as present, staff must take two photos (car photo, VIN photo) as proof.
-   **Display Verification Photos**: Show the actual verification photos in the app's car cards instead of generic image links.
-   **Robust Delete Functionality**: Ensure the delete button works correctly, including an Delete All option.
-   **Login and User Management**: Implement a simple username/password login system. Only admins can create new users, and self-registration is not allowed. Delete functionality (single car, all cars) should be admin-only.
-   **Field Customization**: Replace the 'price' field with 'purchase_date' and 'year' with 'number' to better suit inventory management for garage checking.
-   **Monthly Archiving**: Implement a feature to archive all current vehicles at the end of a month (triggered by an admin-only button). A History tab should display archived vehicles from the last 2-4 months/closures.
-   **Deployment**: Provide instructions for deploying the application on a self-hosted server, including GitHub integration.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, handling all API logic, database interactions, user authentication, and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for car CRUD operations.
        -   MongoDB connection and Pydantic models for , , , .
        -   Endpoints for  (CRUD, CSV import),  (login, user management), and  (create, list).
        -   Implemented JWT authentication with  and  dependencies for role-based access control.
        -   CSV import logic enhanced with BOM character handling and duplicate VIN validation.
        -    field replaced with  (datetime) and  with  (string) in  model.
        -   Admin-only endpoints for deleting single cars, deleting all cars, creating archives, and listing archives.
        -   Startup event to create a default admin user.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: The main React component orchestrating the entire frontend application, including routing, state management, API calls, and conditional UI rendering based on user roles.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial UI for displaying, adding, editing, and deleting cars.
        -   Integrated CSV import dialog with file selection and upload logic.
        -   Implemented camera capture for car and VIN photos during present status updates, displaying base64 images directly.
        -   Implemented JWT token management and user state (, ).
        -   Integrated  and  components, with conditional rendering for admin-specific tabs and actions.
        -   Updated forms and display for  and  fields.
        -   Included a Delete All Cars button and hid individual delete buttons for non-admin users.
        -   Currently being modified to integrate the new  tab and archiving functionality.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Login.js**
    -   **Importance**: A new component specifically for handling user login.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to provide a dedicated login interface, handling username/password input and API calls for authentication.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/UserManagement.js**
    -   **Importance**: A new component for administrators to view and manage users.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to display a list of users and provide an interface for adding new users (admin-only).

-   **/app/README.md**
    -   **Importance**: Project documentation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include comprehensive deployment instructions (Docker, manual), GitHub integration guide, and details on the implemented features including the login system and German localization.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the frontend implementation for the monthly archiving feature, specifically:
    -   Finalize the  component to fetch and display archived cars from the backend.
    -   Fully integrate the Archive Month button in the UI for admins to trigger the archiving process.
    -   Ensure proper date filtering and display for archived history.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately before this request in the process of implementing the monthly archiving and history view feature. This involves a multi-step process:
1.  **Backend Models and Endpoints**: New MongoDB models () and API endpoints (, , ) have been defined in  to handle the archiving logic and retrieval of historical data. The  endpoint is restricted to admin users.
2.  **Frontend Integration (Ongoing)**: The AI engineer is currently modifying  to integrate the new History tab into the main application's tab navigation. This will involve creating or updating the  component to display the archived inventory, and an Archive Month button for administrators to trigger the backend archiving process. The last action was to add the extended tab navigation and the History component to .
